In the part of model, the classes realize the management of all the data and logic. They load the path of images and access their features. The results of classification are stored in the type of string and processed to be shown in various forms. The logic of classification is formulated by the neural network being used. Its topology determines how different layers interact with each other. With the assistance of all the layers, the forward propagation functionality can be implemented, which is the core of algorithms for image classification with pre-trained model.

The part of view realizes the user interfaces. The welcome window and the main window, which contains three different sections, guide the user to upload their input files, select available platforms and operating mode, let them control the process and show the prediction results. 

The controller accepts user inputs handled by the components of the views and converts them to the commands. The classifier controls the progress of processing and assigns the scheduler to dispatch work to workers in heterogeneous platforms. In addition, the poller checks the requests from external systems regularly. After receiving the correct request with the image path, the classifier starts the process of classification.
